Title: Chemical Checker Signaturizer 3D D1-5
Description: Building on the Chemical Checker bioactivity signatures (available as
  eos4u6p), the authors use the relation between stereoisomers and bioactivity of
  over 1M compounds to train stereochemically-aware signaturizers that better describe
  small molecule bioactivity properties. This model corresponds to the Chemical Checker
  spaces D1, D2, D3, D4 and D5.
